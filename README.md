This set of shim files enables the git Tower.app application to use kdiff3 as a diff and merge tool.

Kdiff3 isn't the most "mac-like" application, but it's my favorite merge tool out there as it has full 3-way merging in a 4 pane layout.

Clone this repository to your tower Ã…pplication Support directory and it should show up as a valid diff and merge tool choice within Tower's Preference->Git Config panel.

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Tower
    git clone ~/Library/Application Support/Tower
